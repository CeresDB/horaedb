# Deployment
CeresDB is a distributed timeseries database, that is to say, multiple CeresDB instances can be deployed as a cluster to serve with high availability and scalability.

For now, CeresDB only supports one deployment form that features static, rule-based routing. In the future (maybe in 1.0.0 version), a powerful cluster deployment will be supported and then CeresDB cluster will support more great features, including dynamic expansion, data reliability and etc.

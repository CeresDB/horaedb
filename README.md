[中文](./README-CN.md)

CeresDB is a high-performance, distributed, schema-less, cloud native time-series database that can handle both time-series and analytics workloads.

## Status
The project is currently under rapid development. This early stage is not production ready and may incur data corruptions.

## RoadMap

See our [RoadMap](./docs/dev/roadmap.md)

## User Guide
See https://docs.ceresdb.io/

## Develop
### Compile and run CeresDB
#### Install dependencies
In order to compile CeresDB, some relevant dependencies(including the `Rust` toolchain) should be installed.

#### Dependencies(Ubuntu20.04)
Assuming the development environment is Ubuntu20.04, execute the following command to install the required dependencies:
```shell
apt install git curl gcc g++ libssl-dev pkg-config cmake
```

It should be noted that the compilation of the project has version requirements for dependencies such as cmake, gcc, g++, etc. If your development environment is an old Linux distribution, it is necessary to manually install these dependencies of a higher version.

#### Dependencies(MacOS)
If the development environment is MacOS, execute the following command to install the required dependencies.

1. Install command line tools:
```shell
xcode-select --install
```
2. Install cmake:
```shell
brew install cmake
```

#### Rust
`Rust` can be installed by [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). After installing rustup, when entering the CeresDB project, the specified `Rust` version will be automatically downloaded according to the rust-toolchain file.

After execution, you need to add environment variables to use the `Rust` toolchain. Basically, just put the following commands into your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
```shell
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

#### Compile and run
Compile CeresDB by the following command:
```
cargo build --release
```

Then you can run CeresDB using the default configuration file provided in the codebase.
```bash
./target/release/ceresdb-server --config ./docs/example.toml
```
